# Open Positions Ledger

**AGENT-OWNED.** One block per open **satellite** position. The core holding is not
tracked here — it is never sold on news (§5) and needs no thesis state.

Alpaca is authoritative for what is held and at what cost. This file exists for the
things Alpaca does not store and that §5 cannot be enforced without:

- the **highest close since entry**, without which the §5.4 trailing stop does not exist
- the **timing window deadline**, without which the §5.2 time stop never fires
- the **invalidation condition**, verbatim, because §7 forbids softening it later —
  keeping it written down is what makes softening visible

**High-water maintenance:** the market-close routine writes every open position's official
close into `highest_close` each day (only if it is higher). If a close run was skipped, the
next run must backfill from `python scripts/alpaca.py bars --symbol X --days N` before
evaluating §5.4. A gap in this field silently disables the trailing stop, which is the kind
of failure that looks like nothing is wrong.

### <TICKER> — <thesis-id>

- entry_date:            YYYY-MM-DD
- entry_price:           0.00
- qty:                   0.000
- notional_at_entry:     0.00
- pct_of_account_entry:  0.0%
- voo_close_at_entry:    0.00  (adjustment=all — the same-period baseline for this position)
- asset_type:            stock | etf
- market_cap_at_entry:   $00.0B
- market_cap_source:     <where the figure came from>
- highest_close:         0.00  (as of YYYY-MM-DD)
- timing_window:         <next earnings | Q_ YYYY>  → deadline YYYY-MM-DD
- invalidation:          <verbatim from the thesis, part 4 — never reworded>
- sell_rule_status:      <which of §5.1–5.4 are near triggering, and the distance to each>
- driver:                <the underlying catalyst, for the §4 correlation check>
```

The `driver` line is what makes the correlation check possible. Before opening anything new,
the pre-market routine reads every `driver` here and rejects a candidate exposed to the same
one — otherwise you are making a single bet spread across several tickers and mistaking it
for diversification.

`voo_close_at_entry` is recorded once, at entry, and never updated. The Friday review needs
each position measured against what the same capital would have done in VOO over that
position's own holding window; capturing the baseline at entry means the review never has to
re-derive it from price history, and it stays correct for positions closed months later.
