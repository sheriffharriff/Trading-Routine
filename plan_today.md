# Today's Plan

**AGENT-OWNED. Written by the pre-market routine, consumed by the market-open routine,
overwritten daily.**

This file is the handoff between the two runs. The pre-market run does the thinking and
writes intents here; the market-open run executes them. Nothing gets bought that was not
written here first, which is what forces every buy to sleep on a written thesis instead of
being reasoned into existence at the moment of execution.

The market-open run **re-validates every intent against fresh quotes before acting**. An
intent written at 08:00 can be dead by 09:35 — an overnight gap can push a candidate past
the §4 4%-in-five-sessions priced-in threshold, in which case the trade is skipped and the
skip is logged. A stale intent is a proposal, not an instruction.

## Status

`plan_date` is load-bearing, not a comment. The market-open routine compares it to today's
ET date and **refuses to execute any intent from a plan not dated today** — it logs the
stale plan, posts an alert, and proceeds to the core/rebalance section only.

If the pre-market run failed, was skipped, or crashed before writing, this file still holds
yesterday's intents. Executing them would be running stale research as though it were
fresh — the candidate has had another full session to move, and the §4 priced-in check that
cleared it was performed against prices that no longer exist. Doing nothing is strictly
better. Core and rebalance actions are exempt from the gate because neither depends on the
day's research.

## Template

```
### BUY — <TICKER>
- thesis_id:      T-YYYY-MM-DD-NN   (must already exist in research_log.md)
- asset_type:     stock | etf
- market_cap:     $00.0B  (stocks only; §3 floor is $10B)
- market_cap_src: <source>
- notional:       $0.00   (≤5% of account value, §6)
- driver:         <catalyst, checked against every open position's driver>
- revalidate:     <what would make this dead by the open — the specific number to re-check>

### SELL — <TICKER>
- thesis_id:      T-YYYY-MM-DD-NN
- rule:           §5.1 invalidation | §5.2 time stop | §5.3 hard stop | §5.4 trailing stop
- evidence:       <the observable fact that triggered it>

### REBALANCE — core
- current_core_pct: 0.0%
- action:           buy | sell to return core to 70% (§2)
- notional:         $0.00

## No-trade days

An empty intent list is the expected output most days. §4: *"The correct output of most
research runs is no trade. A run that finds nothing worth buying is a successful run."*
When there is nothing to do, write that plainly here with the reasoning — do not pad the
list to look productive. The rejected candidates still go in `research_log.md`, which is
where the value of a quiet day actually lives.
